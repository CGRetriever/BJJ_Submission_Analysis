# BJJ_Submission_Analysis
The purpose of this is to evaluate the effectiveness of submissions in high-level BJJ competitions.

The web scraper works by going to th BJJHeroes professional competitor list and pulling their records from each individual page. The script then increments the submissions that each competitor used to win their matches. After the tally is completed, the program opens up a barchart using matplotlib (the x-axis is wonky).
